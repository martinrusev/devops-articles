  # Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG):
  # Configure one or more sources to seed the PRNG of the SSL library.
  # The seed data should be of good random quality.
  # WARNING! On some platforms /dev/random blocks if not enough entropy
  # is available. This means you then cannot use the /dev/random device
  # because it would lead to very long connection times (as long as
  # it requires to make more entropy available). But usually those
  # platforms additionally provide a /dev/urandom device which doesn't
  # block. So, if available, use this one instead. Read the mod_ssl User
  # Manual for more details.

  #   Pass Phrase Dialog:
  #   Configure the pass phrase gathering process.
  #   The filtering dialog program (`builtin' is a internal
  #   terminal dialog) has to provide the pass phrase on stdout.

  #   SSL Cipher Suite:
  #   List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.
  #   See the mod_ssl documentation for a complete list.
  #   enable only secure ciphers:
  SSLCipherSuite <%= node['apache']['mod_ssl']['cipher_suite'] %>

  #   Speed-optimized SSL Cipher configuration:
  #   If speed is your main concern (on busy HTTPS servers e.g.),
  #   you might want to force clients to specific, performance
  #   optimized ciphers. In this case, prepend those ciphers
  #   to the SSLCipherSuite list, and enable SSLHonorCipherOrder.
  #   Caveat: by giving precedence to RC4-SHA and AES128-SHA
  #   (as in the example below), most connections will no longer
  #   have perfect forward secrecy - if the server's key is
  #   compromised, captures of past or future traffic must be
  #   considered compromised, too.
