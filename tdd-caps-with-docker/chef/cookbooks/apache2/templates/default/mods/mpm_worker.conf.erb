# StartServers: initial number of server processes to start
# MinSpareThreads: minimum number of worker threads which are kept spare
# MaxSpareThreads: maximum number of worker threads which are kept spare
# ThreadLimit: ThreadsPerChild can be changed to this maximum value during a

# ThreadsPerChild: constant number of worker threads in each server process
# MaxRequestWorkers: maximum number of threads
# MaxConnectionsPerChild: maximum number of requests a server process serves
